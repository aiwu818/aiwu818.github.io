% Problem 1
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{problem}{1}
\textbf{（高等代数，南京师范大学，2024年）}: 设 $W, W_1, W_2$ 是线性空间 $V$ 的子空间, $W_1 \subseteq W, V=W_1 \oplus W_2$. 证明:
$$
\operatorname{dim} W=\operatorname{dim} W_1+\operatorname{dim}\left(W_2 \cap W\right) .
$$

\begin{problem}{2}
\textbf{（高等代数，云南大学，2022年）}: 设 $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \cdots, \alpha_n$ 是线性空间 $V$ 的一组基，问:
$$
\alpha_1+\alpha_2, \alpha_2+\alpha_3, \cdots, \alpha_{n-1}+\alpha_n, \alpha_n+\alpha_1
$$
何时为 $V$ 的一组基，何时不为 $V$ 的一组基? 说明理由.
