% Problem 1
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{problem}{1}
\textbf{（高等代数，重庆大学，2024年）}: 设线性方程组
$$
\left\{\begin{array}{l}
k x_1+x_2+x_3=k-3 ; \\
x_1+k x_2+x_3=-2 ; \\
x_1+x_2+k x_3=-2 .
\end{array}\right.
$$

(1) $k$ 为何值时, 方程组无解?

(2) $k$ 为何值时, 方程组存在唯一解?

(3) $k$ 为何值时, 方程组存在无穷多解? 并求出通解.
\end{problem}

% Problem 2
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{problem}{2}
\textbf{（高等代数，南昌大学，2024年）}: 设 $\alpha_i=\left(a_{i 1}, a_{i 2}, \cdots, a_{i n}\right)(i=1,2, \cdots, s), \beta=\left(b_1, b_2, \cdots, b_n\right)$. 证明: 若线性方程组
$$
\left\{\begin{array}{c}
a_{11} x_1+a_{12} x_2+\cdots+a_{1 n} x_n=0 ; \\
a_{21} x_1+a_{22} x_2+\cdots+a_{2 n} x_n=0 ; \\
\cdots \cdots \\
a_{s 1} x_1+a_{s 2} x_2+\cdots+a_{s n} x_n=0 .
\end{array}\right.
$$
的解全是 $b_1 x_1+b_2 x_2+\cdots+b_n x_n=0$ 的解, 那么 $\beta$ 可经 $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \cdots, \alpha_s$ 线性表出.
