% Problem 1
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{problem}{1}
\textbf{（高等代数，郑州大学，2024年）}: 设 $V=P^{2 \times 2}$ 是数域 $P$ 上的线性空间, $A=\left(\begin{array}{ll}a & b \\ c & d\end{array}\right) \in V$, 线性变换 $\sigma: X \rightarrow A X, \forall X \in P^{2 \times 2}$.

(1)求线性变换 $\sigma$ 在基
$$
E_{11}=\left(\begin{array}{ll}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 0
\end{array}\right), E_{12}=\left(\begin{array}{ll}
0 & 1 \\
0 & 0
\end{array}\right), E_{21}=\left(\begin{array}{ll}
0 & 0 \\
1 & 0
\end{array}\right), E_{22}=\left(\begin{array}{ll}
0 & 0 \\
0 & 1
\end{array}\right)
$$
下的矩阵.

(2) 如果 $A$ 相似于对角矩阵, 证明线性变换 $\sigma$ 在 $V$ 的某组基下的矩阵是对角矩阵.

% Problem 2
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{problem}{2}
\textbf{（线性代数与解析几何，中国科学技术大学，2024年）}: 对于任意向量 $X, Y \in \mathbb{R}^3$, 定义
$$
(X, Y)=X^T\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
2 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 2 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & 2
\end{array}\right) Y .
$$

(1)证明上述定义给出了 $\mathbb{R}^3$ 上的一个内积.

(2)利用 Schmidt 正交化从基向量组 $\alpha_1=(1,0,0)^T, \alpha_2=(1,0,1)^T, \alpha_3=(1,1,0)^T$ 构造一组标准正交基.
