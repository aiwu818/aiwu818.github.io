% Problem 1
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{problem}{1}
\textbf{（高等代数，南开大学，2024年）}: 设 $V=\mathbb{R}[x]_4$ 为次数小于 4 的实系数多项式构成的实线性空间, 定义线性变换 $\sigma: V \rightarrow V$ 如下:
$$
\sigma(f(x))=\left(1-x^2\right) f^{\prime \prime}(x)-2 x f^{\prime}(x), \forall f(x) \in V .
$$
求 $V$ 的一组基, 设 $\sigma$ 在这组基下的矩阵为对角矩阵.

% Problem 2
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{problem}{2}
\textbf{（高等代数，南京师范大学，2024年）}: 设 $V$ 是全体次数不超过 $n$ 的实系数多项式再添上零多项式组成的实数域上的线性空间, 定义$\sigma$ 是 $V$ 上的线性变换: 任给 $f(x) \in V, \sigma(f(x))=x f^{\prime}(x)-f(x)$.

(1) 求 $\sigma$ 的核 $\sigma^{-1}(0)$ 及 $\sigma$ 的值域 $\sigma V$.

(2) 证明: $V=\sigma^{-1}(0) \oplus \sigma V$.
